## Forms:
1. [Passport Update Wizard](https://pptform.state.gov/PassportWizardMain.aspx)
    - The wizard **should** tell you the proper form to fill out, and bring you to it!
    - [**Form DS-82**](https://eforms.state.gov/Forms/ds82_pdf.pdf)
        - If you have a passport already, and it was issued more than a year you will likely be filling out a DS-82 form.
    - **Form DS-5504**
        - If you have a passport already, and it was issued less than one year ago, you will likely be filling out a DS-5504 form.
    - **Form DS-11**
        - If you do not have a passport, you will be filling out a DS-11 form.

## Steps

### Decide how fast you need your Passport
1. [Get My Passport Fast](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast.html) has a selection of estimated times for various passport processing options
    - A sneaky option for "Life-or-Death" or "Urgent" is to book a refundable trip to Canada within your desired timeframe, so you can list that (with proof) in the form filler.

### Filling in the form
1. Fill in the form provided by the [Passport Update Wizard](https://pptform.state.gov/PassportWizardMain.aspx).
2. Print out the form and instructions listed by the wizard after you've filled out all the required fields.

### Renewing by mail
The rest of this guide assumes you are *renewing* an existing passport by mail (using form DS-82). If you're going in-person, follow those instructions.

### Collecting required documents
1. Get a copy of your court order.
2. Get a passport photo, if required (your form should tell you).
    1. See [Passport Photo Requirements](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/photos.html)
3. Get your old Passport Book/Card, if you have one

### Write your check (if your using that payment method)
1. Calculate the required fee using the [Passport Fee Calculator](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/fees.html?cq_ck=1713959252608#Passport%20fee%20calculator)
2. Follow the instructions on your form **closely**. There's a few easy to miss bits, listed here:
    - Checks should be payable to "U.S. Department of State"
    - The check should have your full name and DOB written on it. Your DOB can go on the Memo line.

### Mailing your Passport Documents
- You **must** use USPS to send documents
- USPS recommends using a [Priority Mail Flat Rate Envelope](https://store.usps.com/store/product/shipping-supplies/priority-mail-flat-rate-envelope-P_EP_14_F), 
which you can pick up at any post office.

1. Put all of your documents in the envelope.
2. Put in your check.
3. Fill in the address. **NOTE** If you choose "Expedited Service" the address is *subtly* different. 
The expedited address has a different PO Box. They also request you write "Expedite" on the outer envelope if you chose that option.
4. Send it, and get tracking if you want piece of mind that it's delivered properly!

### Wait!
