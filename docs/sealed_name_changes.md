## Required Forms

There are no official forms for a sealed name change in King County. Helpfully, multiple law groups have provided templates for people to use, and using either is fine as of 11/14/2024.

In either case, there are two forms you need to fill out:
1. **Petition for a name change** - This is your request for a court order to change your name. This is what you file *before* your hearing.
2. **Proposed order for a name change** - This is basically a template court order for the judge to fill out at your hearing. You bring this *to* your hearing.

### Scheduling your hearing online

#### Request a hearing

First step is to request a hearing via the Ex Parte scheduling page. You can get to it from the link in your "schedule.pdf" file, but it's easiest to go direct to the webpage specified below:

1. Navigate to the [Ex Parte Online Scheduling webpage](https://superiorcourt.kingcounty.gov/ex-parte-online-scheduling)
    - ![Ex parte scheduling](/kc-namechange/assets/images/ExParteScheduling.png)
2. Choose "Seattle" in the "Locations" dropdown
3. Pick an available "Adoptions/Name Change" slot
4. Fill in your case number. 
5. After filling in your case number, the Event Type and Event Sub Type boxes should only have one option each, so select them:
    1. Event Type: EXP Civil Motion
    2. Event Sub Type: Sealed Name change
6. Fill in the "Moving Party Information" with your previous legal name
7. Leave "Responding Party Information" blank
8. Click Submit

You should get a confirmation page, as well as a confirmation email.

*Before you leave the confirmation page, make sure to download the Notice of Motion*. 

Page:
![Confirmation Page](/kc-namechange/assets/images/ScheduleConfirmationPage.jpg) 

Email:
![Confirmation Email](/kc-namechange/assets/images/ScheduleConfirmationEmail.jpg)

**Note:** You can skip all steps related to:
- Order to Show Cause
- Serving other Parties
- Submitting Working Papers or Proposed Orders

These are not applicable for name changes at this point.

Note that "Notice of Motion" and "Notice of Court Date" refer to the same form, but "Notice of Motion" is pre-filled with *your specific information*, which makes the next steps easier.

If you forget to download your "Notice of Motion", you can find a *blank* Notice of Court Date form here: [Notice of Court Date Forms](https://kingcounty.gov/en/court/superior-court/courts-jails-legal-system/notice-of-court-date-forms)

#### File a Notice of Court Date

Fill in your Notice of Court Date / Notice of Motion. If your form is pre-filled, use the value that is prefilled:
1. In the upper left blank area, list your case name, usually "IN RE <DEADNAME>"
2. In the upper right, where it says CASE NO., list your case number
3. In the "To the Superior Clerk and All Parties" Section:
    1. List your scheled date time
    2. For the "calendar" spot, fill in "Ex Parte/Probate Adoptions/Name Change"
    3. For "The name of the motion is", fill in "EXP Civil Motion - Sealed Name Change"
    4. For "The motion was filed on" put the current date. For "by" put your previous legal name.
    5. Fill in your preferred email.
    6. Check the "Adoptions/Name Change" boxes
4. Finally, sign and date the document, and check the box for the email address you'd like to use

Now you should be good to go!

2. Choose "Seattle" in the "Locations" dropdown
3. Choose the date/time you chose from the calendar
4. Look for your case number, and the Event Status. Once the Status is "Scheduled", you're good to go!

### Attending your hearing

- [Courthouse Webpage](https://kingcounty.gov/en/court/superior-court/courts-jails-legal-system/court-calendars-locations-operations/superior-court-locations/king-county-courthouse)
- [Superior Court Directory](https://kingcounty.gov/en/-/media/courts/superior-court/docs/locations/kcch-brochure.ashx)
- [Superior Court Clerk Webpage](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/dja/courts-jails-legal-system/court-calendars-locations-operations/locations-hours)

> **Note:** Because there are two forms of name change, sealed and unsealed, you *might* get bad directions from courthouse employees who don't know you're doing a *sealed* name change. 
>
> Be sure, if you're asking questions or being directed, that the employee knows you are there for a ***sealed*** name change in ***Superior*** court (vs an ***unsealed*** name change in ***District*** court).
>
> They should then direct you appropriately.

#### The hearing itself

1. Gather your required Documents/Info
    1. A valid government ID in your previous legal Name
    2. A copy of your filled in proposed order
    3. Your case number
        - I found it very helpful to have a printed page with my case number for various courthouse employees to read. You can use cics.pdf for this, or make your own even simpler page!
2. Go to the Courthouse
3. Go to the Ex Parte department for your scheduled hearing time.
    - To find it, you can look in the directory in the lobby. It is in room W-325 on the 3rd floor (as of 11/20/2024).
    - **Note:** You might see screens with a schedule and freak out because you don't see your name. Don't worry! Ex Parte cases aren't listed on the TVs!
4. Attend your hearing
    - You'll be let into the room, and asked to sit on a bench while you wait for your turn.
    - Once in the room, the judge will ask for your proposed order, look it over, and if everything looks correct, sign it
    - You're done with the hearing!

#### Getting certified copies of your order

You'll now need to bring your signed order to the Superior Court Clerk's Office. They are on the 6th floor, E-609 (as of 11/20/2024).

1. Have the clerk file the original order, and make as many certified copies as you would like.

As of 11/20/2024, prices for certified copies are as follows:

- For each copy:
    - $5.00 / copy for the first Page
    - $1.00 / copy for each additional page
    - (So, for example, a 3-page Proposed Order costs $5.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 = $7.00 for one copy)
    
You can pay with credit card or check (not sure about cash). 

There is an additional fee for using a credit card:
- If your total fee is less than $60.00
    - $1.49
- If your total fee is more than $60.00
    - 2.49% of the total fee


### You're all done! Congratulations!
