In either case, there are two forms you need to fill out:
1. **Petition for a name change** - This is your request for a court order to change your name. This is what you file *before* your hearing.
2. **Proposed order for a name change** - This is basically a template court order for the judge to fill out at your hearing. You bring this *to* your hearing.

#### Scheduling your hearing online

**Request a hearing**

First step is to request a hearing via the Ex Parte scheduling page. You can get to it from the link in your "schedule.pdf" file, but it's easiest to go direct to the webpage specified below:

1. Navigate to the [Ex Parte Online Scheduling webpage](https://superiorcourt.kingcounty.gov/ex-parte-online-scheduling)
    - ![Ex parte scheduling](/kc-namechange/assets/images/ExParteScheduling.png)
2. Choose "Seattle" in the "Locations" dropdown
3. Pick an available "Adoptions/Name Change" slot
4. Fill in your case number. 
5. After filling in your case number, the Event Type and Event Sub Type boxes should only have one option each, so select them:
    1. Event Type: EXP Civil Motion
    2. Event Sub Type: Sealed Name change
6. Fill in the "Moving Party Information" with your previous legal name
7. Leave "Responding Party Information" blank
8. Click Submit

You should get a confirmation page, as well as a confirmation email.

*Before you leave the confirmation page, make sure to download the Notice of Motion*. 
Note that "Notice of Motion" and "Notice of Court Date" refer to the same form, but "Notice of Motion" is pre-filled with *your specific information*, which makes the next steps easier.
If you forget to download your "Notice of Motion", you can find a *blank* Notice of Court Date form here: [Notice of Court Date Forms](https://kingcounty.gov/en/court/superior-court/courts-jails-legal-system/notice-of-court-date-forms)

**File a Notice of Court Date**
Fill in your Notice of Court Date / Notice of Motion. If your form is pre-filled, use the value that is prefilled:
1. In the upper left blank area, list your case name, usually "IN RE <DEADNAME>"
2. In the upper right, where it says CASE NO., list your case number
3. In the "To the Superior Clerk and All Parties" Section:
    1. List your scheled date time
    2. For the "calendar" spot, fill in "Ex Parte/Probate Adoptions/Name Change"
    3. For "The name of the motion is", fill in "EXP Civil Motion - Sealed Name Change"
    4. For "The motion was filed on" put the current date. For "by" put your previous legal name.
    5. Fill in your preferred email.
    6. Check the "Adoptions/Name Change" boxes
4. Finally, sign and date the document, and check the box for the email address you'd like to use
